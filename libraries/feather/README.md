# Feather
Feather is a minimal CSS framework to make websites that are as light as a feather.

See my [180 Websites in 180 Days Project](http://180io.com) for some more fun!

## Run Locally
   
1. Link to [feather.min.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KingPixil/Feather/master/feather.min.css)

   ```
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KingPixil/Feather/master/feather.min.css"/>
   ```
2. Run your project locally from the command line.

3. Visit the application at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## How to Use
1. Link to Feather
   ```
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KingPixil/Feather/gh-pages/css/feather.css"/>
   <script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KingPixil/Feather/gh-pages/js/feather.js"></script>
   ```
   
### The grid
1. The grid is made up of rows and columns.
2. Make a row by adding
   ```
   class="row"
   ```
3. A row is made up of twelve columns, to make a column, do:
   ```
   <div class="span six"></div>
   ```
   The above example will make a div span six columns. Just add the class column, and one-twelve.
   
4. You did it!

### Buttons
1. Just add the class btn and btn-1 through btn-6.

### Animations
   Add the class "animate" and the name of the animation, so far there is:
   * bounce
   * bounceIn
   * fadeIn
